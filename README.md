# Network Automation ACL

ACL (Access Control List) is a set of rules that controls and manages access to network resources by specifying which users or system processes are granted or denied access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed or disallowed. ACLs are commonly used in network security to regulate traffic and define permissions for various entities within a network, such as routers or firewalls.

The script `aacl.py`, developed by n3r, ad3n, hyc4rl and boredzz, for our ITT633 assingment, provide a friendly user interface for automating the ACL configuration on the network.

It supports Extendend and Standard ACL configuration only.

Thanks üëç

Note: This script was tested on virtual environment only. We don't know if it will work on the real network.
